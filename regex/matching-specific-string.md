***In the above image, a Regex Pattern in matched with the Test String***

Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as: code, log files, spreadsheets, documents, etc.

We can match a specific string **X** in a test string **S** by making our regex pattern **X**. This is one of the simplest patterns. However, in the coming challenges, we'll see how well we can match more complex patterns and learn about their syntax.

### Task

You have a test string **S**. Your task is to match the string hackerrank. This is case sensitive.

**Note**

This is a regex only challenge. You are not required to write code.

You only have to fill in the regex pattern in the blank (_________).
