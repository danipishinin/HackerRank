#### Note: If you want to match (.) in the test string, you need to escape the dot by using a slash \.. In Java, use \\. instead of \..

### Task

You have a test string **S**.
Your task is to write a regular expression that matches only and exactly strings of form: **abc.def.ghu.jkx**, where each variable **a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,x** can be any single character except the newline.
