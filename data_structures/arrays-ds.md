# Array DS

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, **A**, of size **N**,each memory location has some unique index, **i** (where **0 <= i < N**), that can be referenced as **A[i]** or **A<sub>i</sub>**.

Reverse an array of integers.

**Note**: If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

**Example**
**A = [1,2,3]**
Return **[3,2,1]**

### Function Description
