# Ruby Tutorial - Object Methods

Each object in Ruby may have methods associated with it. To demonstrate this, we want you to print whether a number is even or odd. A number has an even? method associated with it, which returns true or false based on the parity of the number.

Assuming a variable number is already defined, check whether a given number is even or not.

### Hint
Type in the code-editor

~~~rb
return number.even?
~~~
or

~~~rb
number.even?
~~~

### Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer **n**. The next **n** contains one integer in each line.

### Output Format

The output is handled by the code written in the editor.
